# Client's Website A/B Test Results Analysis
## by Shakhawat Hassan


Goal: Helped a client to understand if they should keep the implemented new page or keep the old page.

## Summary of findings
After running this rigorous data analysis, I can conclude that implenmenting a new webpage would not make any differences based on A/B test results and analysis. Therefore, the client should keep the old page.
